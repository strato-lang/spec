# Strato
Strato is a fork from English made for human clarity and NLP processing simplicity. It aims to be mostly mutually intelligible by English speakers, but it's less of a goal and more of a short-term plan.
## Principles
Strato starts from a subset of English. We then have "compound words."

A compound word is a combination of 2 or more words to create a new word with new meaning. It makes new words easier to understand, say, and create. 

Strato also enforces SVO for word order. Prefixes and suffixes are also standard across all words. Instead of `drove`, it's `drived`. Instead of `flew`, it's `flied`.
We also introduce a new suffix for the future tense, `-il`. You would not say that you `will fly`, but that you `flil`.
You would not say `I will buy food at the shop`, but `I buyil food at the shop`. This organizes all tenses into simple suffixes, making English easier to understand.

Things like pronouns are modified to be better pointers to the subject. All in all, everything makes it more clear for humans and easier to parse by NLP.
Plus, it makes tokenizers easier.
