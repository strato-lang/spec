# Strato Specification

## Spelling
Strato takes English spelling and changes it in multiple ways.
### Vowels
We will take multiple new letters.

`ah` = `ä`

`eh` = `ë`

`ih` = `ï`

`oh` = `ö`

`oo` = `ō`

`uh / ə` = `ü`

`æ / ay` = `ā`
### Other Letters
English has many sounds we will augment.

`ck` = `q`

`sh` = `š`

`ch` = `tš`

`qu` = `qw`

`ng` = `ņ`
### Pronouns
Strato also makes some changes to the pronoun system.

We choose to remove the remnants of the case system from pronouns.
`he` and `him` become one, `he`. `še` and `her` become one, `še`.

We will separate the Singular They and Multiple They into two.
`they (singular)` stays `thā`, while `they (multiple)` becomes `thäō`.

## Grammar
Strato adopts an Austronesian-style focus grammar system, in which markers precede what they are referring to.

`Topic/Object marker` = `tä`

`Actor marker` = `sï`

`Location, direction, or instrument marker` = `nï`

`Question particle` = `bä`
## Examples
Here are some examples of English put into Strato:

`I work a daily wage at the commision for human safety.` = `Sï I würk tä ü dāily wāge nï ät thü cümïšün för hōmün sāfüty.`

`She asks him a question with a pen at the park.` = `Sï še äsks tä he tä ü qwëstšün nï wïth ü pën nï ät thü pärk.`

`Do they bring the book to school for their teacher?` = `Bä sï thäō brïņ tä thü bōk nï tō skōl nï för thër tītšër.`
